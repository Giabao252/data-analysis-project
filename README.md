This is my CS181 - Data Systems final project. For this project, we used data analysis methods to answer our central question: 

*What are the major factors contributing to the huge number of casualties in the Russia - Ukraine war*

we used Python, SQL, Python pandas library, and requests for web-scraping data, and plotly library for data visualizatons (graphs, tables,etc)
